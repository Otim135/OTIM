    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This code is typically used within a loop to find the largest number in a list of numbers. Here's the context where you might see this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [15, 22, 8, 19, 31, 10, 5, 21]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize max_number to be the first element in the list\n",
    "max_number = numbers[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through each number in the list\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    # Check if the current number is greater than the current max_number\n",
    "    if number > max_number:\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Maximum number: {max_number}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of `if number > max_number: max_number = number`\n",
    "- **`if number > max_number:`**: This line checks whether the current number (from the list) is greater than the value currently stored in `max_number`.\n",
    "    - **`number`**: This represents the current number from the list that we are examining in the loop.\n",
    "    - **`max_number`**: This is the variable that holds the largest number found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`max_number = number`**: If the condition `number > max_number` is true (meaning the current number is larger than the current `max_number`), then this line updates `max_number` to be the current number. This way, `max_number` always holds the largest number found so far as we continue through the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "Consider the list of numbers `[15, 22, 8, 19, 31, 10, 5, 21]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "    - `max_number` is initialized to the first element of the list: `max_number = 15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Iterations**:\n",
    "    - **First iteration**: `number = 15`\n",
    "        - `if 15 > 15`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `15`.\n",
    "    - **Second iteration**: `number = 22`\n",
    "        - `if 22 > 15`: This is true, so `max_number` is updated to `22`.\n",
    "    - **Third iteration**: `number = 8`\n",
    "        - `if 8 > 22`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `22`.\n",
    "    - **Fourth iteration**: `number = 19`\n",
    "        - `if 19 > 22`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `22`.\n",
    "    - **Fifth iteration**: `number = 31`\n",
    "        - `if 31 > 22`: This is true, so `max_number` is updated to `31`.\n",
    "    - **Sixth iteration**: `number = 10`\n",
    "        - `if 10 > 31`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `31`.\n",
    "    - **Seventh iteration**: `number = 5`\n",
    "        - `if 5 > 31`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `31`.\n",
    "    - **Eighth iteration**: `number = 21`\n",
    "        - `if 21 > 31`: This is false, so `max_number` remains `31`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **End of Loop**:\n",
    "    - After all iterations, `max_number` holds the largest number in the list, which is `31`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- The code `if number > max_number: max_number = number` is used to update the maximum number found in a list.\n",
    "- It compares each number in the list with the current maximum (`max_number`).\n",
    "- If the current number is greater than the current maximum, it updates `max_number` to the current number.\n",
    "- By the end of the loop, `max_number` contains the largest number in the list.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Step 1: Initialize the List of Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",

    "sum_even = 0\n",
    "sum_odd = 0\n",

    "  - `sum_odd` will store the sum of odd numbers.\n",
    "  - Both variables are initially set to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Loop Through Each Number in the List\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loop through each number in the list\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: We use a `for` loop to go through each number in the `numbers` list one by one. The variable `number` will take on the value of each element in the list during each iteration of the loop.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "- **Explanation**: Inside the loop, we check if the current number (`number`) is even or odd using an `if-else` statement:\n",
    "  - **`if number % 2 == 0:`**:\n",
    "    - The expression `number % 2` computes the remainder when `number` is divided by `2`.\n",
    "    - If the remainder is `0`, it means the number is even.\n",
    "    - `sum_even += number` adds the current number to the `sum_even` variable.\n",
    "  - **`else:`**:\n",
    "    - If the number is not even, it must be odd.\n",

    "### Context\n",
    "This code takes a list of words and counts the frequency of each word. It then prints each word along with its count.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Initialize the List of Words\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example list of words\n",
    "words = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: We start with a list of words, which includes some repeated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create an Empty Dictionary to Store Word Frequencies\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dictionary to store the frequency of each word\n",
    "word_count = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: We initialize an empty dictionary called `word_count` where:\n",
    "  - The keys will be the words from the list.\n",
    "  - The values will be the counts of how many times each word appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Loop Through Each Word in the List\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loop through each word in the list\n",
    "for word in words:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: We use a `for` loop to go through each word in the `words` list one by one. The variable `word` will take on the value of each element in the list during each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Check if the Word is Already in the Dictionary and Update the Count\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Check if the word is already in the dictionary\n",
    "    if word in word_count:\n",
    "        word_count[word] += 1  # Increment the count\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        word_count[word] = 1  # Initialize the count\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Inside the loop, we check if the current word (`word`) is already a key in the `word_count` dictionary:\n",
    "  - **`if word in word_count:`**:\n",
    "    - If the word is already in the dictionary, it means we've encountered it before.\n",
    "    - `word_count[word] += 1` increments the count of that word by 1.\n",
    "  - **`else:`**:\n",
    "    - If the word is not in the dictionary, it means this is the first time we've encountered it.\n",
    "    - `word_count[word] = 1` adds the word to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Print the Word Frequencies\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print the word frequencies\n",
    "for word, count in word_count.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"Word: {word}, Count: {count}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: After counting the frequencies of all words, we print each word along with its count:\n",
    "  - `word_count.items()` returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.\n",
    "  - `for word, count in word_count.items():` iterates over these pairs.\n",
    "  - `print(f\"Word: {word}, Count: {count}\")` prints each word and its count using an f-string for formatting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This code is used to print each score along with its corresponding grade from two lists: `scores` and `grades`. The `zip` function is used to pair each score with its corresponding grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The `zip` Function**:\n",
    "    - The `zip` function takes two (or more) lists and pairs up their elements, creating an iterator of tuples.\n",
    "    - For example, if `scores = [95, 82, 67]` and `grades = ['A', 'B', 'D']`, `zip(scores, grades)` creates an iterator with the pairs `(95, 'A')`, `(82, 'B')`, and `(67, 'D')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The `for` Loop**:\n",
    "    - The `for` loop iterates over each pair created by the `zip` function.\n",
    "    - In each iteration, `score` gets the value from the `scores` list and `grade` gets the corresponding value from the `grades` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The `print` Statement**:\n",
    "    - The `print` function outputs a formatted string that includes the current `score` and `grade`.\n",
    "    - The `f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\"` is an f-string (formatted string) that allows embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example lists\n",
    "scores = [95, 82, 67]\n",
    "grades = ['A', 'B', 'D']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through each pair of score and grade\n",
    "for score, grade in zip(scores, grades):\n",
    "    # Print the score and the corresponding grade\n",
    "    print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **zip(scores, grades)**: Pairs elements from `scores` and `grades` lists.\n",
    "- **for score, grade in zip(scores, grades)**: Iterates over these pairs.\n",
    "- **print(f\"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}\")**: Prints each score with its corresponding grade using an f-string for formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures each score is printed alongside its corresponding grade in a clear and readable format."
